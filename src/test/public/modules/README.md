# Modules

Modules act as stand-alone (and optionally interoperable) pieces of code that allow the system to have functionality. The "base" code is an architecture that allows the plug-and-play of these modules throughout various projects.

The modules found in this directory are _not_ meant to be used in a wider context - they are prototypes to examine how I can further the core code to allow for more interesting functionality between either the end-user of the system or the modules themselves.

...the end goal is that this container can be used to quickly spin up projects that rely on actual modules (from NPM) as their core. The container will not come with any pre-installed modules and the goal is to therefore be as barebones as possible.
